# Hey everyoneâ€¦ Been a while!

Sorry for the lack of updates, and a very long wait on the cancelled build. We still wanted to clean it up and finish it, but nobody wanted to do it, so now, here it is! 
Please keep in mind this build is VERY buggy, and nearly all menus tank performance a LOT. Playing songs should be fine though!

We at Team Reimagination talked a lot about this mod, its issues, its influence, our thoughts, etc. We have come to a conclusion about how we would like to handle this mod, universe and characters going forward. 
The mod is now getting renamed to Legacy Edition, in accordance with our plans and how we want to do this.

Even though the project is cancelled, we are still very grateful for the impact and love this project has had, and we hope to deliver on our next ones even more!

Again, we hope you enjoy the buggy mess we have, and thank you for staying with us this whole time! Our plans are not over yet, we have a LOT of stuff cooking and planned on the backburner, and we want to provide as much in as little time as we can! 
(While keeping our workflow nice and healthy of course!)

Thank you, and have a great rest of your day! - Cassandra, on behalf of Team Reimagination
