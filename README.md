# Vs. Bamber & Davey Public Github

## As of writing this (May 3rd 2025), we are changing how development will work.
### Ever wanted to work on the mod? Well not you can, because we are encouraging pull requests!
If you wanna port, fix, or add something, you can do so through a pull request, and we'll check if it's up to standard.

### What about us?
We'll still work on it but we will work on it at any time, even if it might be months after a commit. And you guys get to see changes in the real time, either by following the repository or through the [Team Reimagination Discord server](https://www.discord.com/CqXK5gtW4m). Most things will happen over there, like polls and stuff. You opt in to this yourself.

### What can we make pull requests for?
- Porting of features from Bamber & Davey Vol.2
- Fixing bugs
- Adding new songs
- Adding new Miscellaneous Features

### How long this will last?
Probably so long as we're alive.

### How will the updates be measured?
After 2.5, we will be ditching versions entirely and rely on the github for everything. This might come with a lot of pulling from the repository, so prepare yourselves.

### Will there be a TODO?
Yes, there will be a TODO. Especially since we might not work on the mod super often after the repository becomes public.
Check [TODO.md](https://github.com/Team-Reimagination/vs-bamber-en-codename-enjine/blob/main/TODO.md) to see it.
